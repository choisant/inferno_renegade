Examples variate related width object; age person; one coordinate object particular reference system. continuous variate requires specification fields domainmin, domainmax, datastep, minincluded, maxincluded, plotmin, plotmax. naturally continuous variates often rounded given precision; instance, age person might reported rounded nearest year (25 years, 26 years, ); length object might reported nearest centimetre (1 m, 1.01 m, 1.02 m, ). minimum distance rounded values must reported datastep field; 1 age example 0.01 length example .

Possible values real number, +Inf, empty value, interpreted +Inf. domainmin, maximum value depends context. age-related variate theoretically domainmax equal +Inf; given study categorizes people \"90 years old older\", domainmax set 90. datastep: minimum distance values variate (ordinal continuous). Possible values positive real number, 0, empty value, interpreted 0. numeric ordinal variate, datastep step consecutive values. continuous rounded variate, datastep minimum distance different values occurs rounding; see examples given . function buildmetadata heuristics determine whether variate rounded .
