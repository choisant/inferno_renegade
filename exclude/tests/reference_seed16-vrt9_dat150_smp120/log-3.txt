Defining model
  [Note] 'Dlatinit' is provided in 'constants' but not used in the model code and is being ignored.

Building model
Setting data and initial values
Running calculate on model
  [Note] Any error reports that follow may simply reflect missing values in model variables.
Checking model sizes and dimensions
  [Note] This model is not fully initialized. This is not an error.
         To see which variables are not initialized, use model$initializeInfo().
         For more information on model initialization, see help(modelInitialization).
Compiling
  [Note] This may take a minute.
  [Note] Use 'showCompilerOutput = TRUE' to see C++ compilation details.
